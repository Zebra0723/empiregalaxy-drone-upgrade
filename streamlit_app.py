    - **Highlight safety:** Propeller guards and auto-return features mean fewer accidents and more peace of mind.
    - **Include everyone:** Invite your parents to try the goggles and experience flying firsthand.
    - **Show the future:** Voice commands and motion control are the next generation of dronesâ€”why stay in the past?
